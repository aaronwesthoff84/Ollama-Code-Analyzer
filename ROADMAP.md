# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the Gemini Code Execution & Review Tool.

## Planned Features

1.  **Save and Load Code Sessions:**
    -   Allow users to save their current code and test inputs to their browser's local storage.
    -   Provide a "Load" button to restore the saved session.
    -   This will help users persist their work between sessions without needing to copy/paste from an external editor.

2.  **Dockerfile Support:**
    -   Modify the application to support Dockerfiles.
    -   This includes adding Dockerfile to the language selection dropdown.
    -   Update the placeholder example for Dockerfiles.
    -   Register Dockerfile with highlight.js for proper syntax highlighting.
    -   Update the language auto-detection logic to include Dockerfile.

3. **add the ability to clear the code**
